A detailed guide to contributing to the Conveyor CI Driver runtime.

<!-- truncate -->

## Introduction

A brief introduction on the Conveyor CI Driver runtime.

The Conveyor CI Driver runtime is a collection of SDKs(Software Devlopment Kits) used by developers to build Conveyor CI [Drivers](https://conveyor.open.ug/docs/concepts/terminology/drivers.md). These SDKs are libraries that contain Utility functions that expose different Conveyor CI functionality. In this Guide we shall explore how one can contribute to the Conveyor CI Driver Runtime. This Guide is written to be language agnostic, meaning it can guide you to build or contribute to a driver runtime of your language of choice.

## How the Driver Runtime Works

Lets explore what the Runtime is

### What is the Driver Runtime

You can think of the Driver runtime as the wrapper of Driver applications and is the environment in which Drivers execute. You can define it as the software layer that provides necessary services, infrastructure, and behavior for executing the driver. Think of how language runtime work like the JVM, Go Runtime, V8, CPython etc. If you where to write a program in those languages, run in an enviroment that contains your code and the language runtime.

So even when building a Conveyor CI Driver, the final program is a combination of the Driver runtime and your custom Driver code.

### What Features does it Provide

As mentioned earlier, the driver runtime provides necessary services and utilities for building CI Drivers. Some of these features are not just exclusive to the runtime but rather and extension of the base features provided by the Conveyor CI Ecosystem. These features include:

- A realtime Event System: The driver runtime is designed to ensure drivers recieve and publish events within the Conveyor System to ensure quick and instant execution of taks.
- Log Management: The Driver runtime provided a [Driver Logger](https://conveyor.open.ug/docs/concepts/terminology/drivers.md#driver-logger), that provides drivers with functionality to export and save necessary logs in realtime. These can then be fetched or streamed in realtime or for future use.
- Horizontal Scaling: The Driver runtime provides out of the box Horizontal Scaling to Drivers, meaning once you build a driver. It comes with the ability to horizontaly scale into a distributed system effeciently without you writing any custom code. This feature can be really important in Cloud Native environments.
- Conveyor CI API Server Interaction: No driver runtime package is complete without utility functions to interact with the Conveyor API Server to for example create and manipulate Resources.
- Observability out of the Box: The Driver runtime is designed to provide a comprehensive observability platfor that follows all the three prillars that include Metrics, Tracing and Logging.

And many more...

### Driver runtime Compoments

The Driver runtime contains mainly two components. The Driver Manager and the Client Library.

### Driver Manager

The Driver manager, the component that encapsules the Driver and provides utilities that are used by the Driver. By design, it is usually a `Class` or a Class-like data type that has a `run()` method that is called to start the program. Its is resposible for the following functionality.

- Listening for events from Conveyor CI sent via NATS Jetstream: This is accomplished using JetStream [Streams](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream/streams) and [Consumers](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream/consumers). The Driver manager contains a Consumer that listens for events from the `messages` stream and filters out subjects depending on the resources that the Driver defines to listen to.
- Provides the Driver Logger to the Driver. The driver logger is a componnet that collects logs from the driver and send them to Grafana Loki for Storage. After storing them it also streams them via a NATS connection on the subject with the following semantics `driver:{DRIVER_NAME}:logs:{RUN_ID}` with the place holders `DRIVER_NAME` and `RUN_ID` refering to the name of the driver and the current run id respectively.
- Runs the `Reconcile` function of the Drivers upon each event from JetStream and passes in the approriate parameters.

### Driver Logger

The Driver logger component is in charge of collecting logs from the Driver, sending them to Loki Grafana for storage and also streaming them via the NATs connection. It accomplished this by following the rules stated above in the Driver manager section

![Conveyor CI Driver Logger Class Diagram](/img/Driver-Logger-class-driver.png)

### Driver

The Driver is the main component that developers interact with. It contains the `Reconcile` function that contains the custom code that includes the drivers intended functionality. When initialising it, the constructor must require the developer to specify the Resources that the driver wants to control, the driver name and also the Recocile function. The Reconcile function, is a function that takes in these parameters. `payload`, `event`, `driverName`, `logger`.

### Client Library

The client Library is a component of the driver runtime that contains funtions that interact with the Conveyor CI API Server. these are normal HTTP Requests to the API Server. It also has the ability to fetch Conveyor CI API Server metadata like the API Host and Port.

> **Note**: The Class Diagrams above represent the general expected Structure of those components however due to differences is language syntax and semantics in pragramming languages. The structure can be tweaked to provide the Developers a good user experience.

## Contributing Guide

Now that you have a solid understanding of the high level structure of the Driver runtime. Lets move on to the practical guide of the Workflow of Contributing to or building a driver runtime SDK package. Shall first go through the Development Environment setup then also go through the general contribution workflow followed when contributing to the source code of official Conveyor CI Driver runtime SDKs.

### Environment Setup

To setup your environment to run conveyor, all you need is to have Docker installed on you computer. You can head over to the [Docker Istallation Page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install it on your system.

Once you have it, you will need to download two configuration files that are used to run Conveyor API Server and System dependencies. Head over to the [Conveyor ci Realeases Page](https://github.com/open-ug/conveyor/releases) and on the assests of the latest release, download `compose.yml` and `loki.yml` and store them in the same directory. Or you can simply run these commands.

```sh
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/open-ug/conveyor/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | grep compose.yml | cut -d '"' -f 4 | xargs curl -L -o compose.yml

curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/open-ug/conveyor/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | grep loki.yml | cut -d '"' -f 4 | xargs curl -L -o loki.yml
```

Once you have both those files in the same directory, you can then start the Conveyor CI COntainers by running.

```sh
docker compose up

# OR

docker compose up -d
```

> Take note of the ports and host that these containers run no, or you can just open the `compose.yml` file and see what ports are being exposed so when you are developing the packages, you are aware what ports and host to connect to. Also note that incase its a requirement to set different Ports or you want to caonfigure your own ports. always follow the convention of setting environment variable `CONVEYOR_SERVER_HOST` and `CONVEYOR_SERVER_PORT`

Once you have everything running your are good to go onto development.

### Workflow

We welcome contributions of all kinds, Whether you're fixing a typo, reporting a bug, improving documentation, or adding a new feature, your help is appreciated. However when contributing to the Driver runtime, you need to follow a specific contribution workflow.

There are multiple kinds of contributions we follow and they include
