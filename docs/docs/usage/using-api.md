# Using the API

Conveyor CI provides interactive API documentation through **Swagger UI**, available at the route: `/swagger/index.html`

Once the API Server is running, open this route in your browser to explore the API.  

Swagger UI offers:

- A complete list of available API routes.  
- Detailed documentation for request and response parameters.  
- An interactive console to try out API calls directly from your browser.  

It should look like this:

Since Swagger does not natively support WebSockets, the websocket routes wont be available.
